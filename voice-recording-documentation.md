# Voice Recording Flow for Mobile Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the voice recording functionality for the Vocalyx mobile application, specifically focused on recording student information and scores. The voice recording feature allows teachers to quickly input data using voice commands instead of manual entry, particularly useful in classroom settings.

## Voice Recording Workflows

### 1. Student Registration Via Voice Recording

#### Flow Diagram
```
Courses → Classes → Add Students → Voice Recording Option
```

#### Process Steps
1. **Initiate Recording**
   - Navigate to a specific class
   - Select "Add Students" option
   - Choose "Voice Recording" input method
   - Tap microphone icon to start recording

2. **Voice Input Format**
   - For each student, speak clearly in the format: "[First Name], [Last Name], [ID Number (optional)]"
   - Pause between students (2-second pause recognized as a new entry)
   - Example: "John Smith 12345, Maria Garcia 12346, David Lee 12347"

3. **Review & Confirmation**
   - System displays recognized entries in a table format
   - Each entry shows:
     - First and Last Name
     - ID Number (if provided)
     - Confidence level of voice recognition
   - Teacher can edit any incorrect entries
   - Select "Confirm" to add students to class roster

4. **Data Export & Storage**
   - Data is converted to Excel/CSV format
   - Automatically associated with the current class
   - Available for download or sharing

### 2. Score Recording Via Voice Recognition

#### Flow Diagram
```
Courses → Classes → Class Roster → Record Scores
```

#### Process Steps
1. **Initiate Score Recording**
   - Open an existing class with student roster
   - Select "Record Scores" option
   - Choose the assessment/column to record scores for
   - Tap microphone icon to start recording

2. **Voice Input Format**
   - Speak in the format: "[Last Name] [Score]"
   - System identifies the student by last name in the roster
   - Example: "Smith 85, Garcia 92, Lee 78"

3. **Name Matching & Verification**
   - System matches spoken last name to existing roster entries
   - If exact match found: score is automatically assigned
   - If similar match found (80%+ confidence): system asks for confirmation
   - If multiple matches or low confidence match:
     - System shows possible matches
     - Teacher can select correct student or speak again with additional identifiers

4. **Error Handling & Fallbacks**
   - After 3 failed attempts to match a name:
     - System prompts: "Please specify student ID number"
     - Teacher can say: "ID [number] [score]" (e.g., "ID 12345 85")
     - ID numbers provide unambiguous identification

5. **Batch Processing & Review**
   - After all scores are recorded, system displays summary
   - Teachers can review, edit, or re-record any entries
   - Confirm to save all scores to the roster

## User Interface Elements

### Voice Recording Button
- Prominent microphone icon
- Color indicators:
  - Gray: Not recording
  - Red: Recording in progress
  - Yellow: Processing speech
  - Green: Successfully processed

  - Select from list of possible matches
  - Try again with clearer pronunciation
  - Use ID number instead

## Technical Requirements

### Speech Recognition Capabilities
- Support for multiple languages and accents
- Noise cancellation for classroom environments
- Specialized dictionary for educational terms and common names
- High accuracy for numerical values (test scores)

### Data Processing
- Real-time processing and feedback
- Offline capability for areas with limited connectivity
- Batch processing option for multiple entries
- Integration with existing Excel/CSV imports

### Security & Privacy
- Student data encryption
- Optional anonymization for reports

## Implementation Considerations

### Performance Optimizations
- Preload student roster data for faster matching
- Cache voice processing results
- Optimize for mobile battery consumption

### Accessibility Features
- Visual feedback for hearing-impaired users
- Alternative input methods available
- High contrast UI elements
- Adjustable sensitivity and speaking rate

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Recognition Features**
   - Multi-column voice input (e.g., record multiple assessment scores at once)
   - Recognition of student nicknames or preferred names
   - Context-aware recognition (e.g., understanding course-specific terminology)

2. **Analytics & Insights**
   - Voice entry error rate tracking
   - Speed comparison vs. manual entry
   - Pattern recognition for grading trends

3. **Integration Capabilities**
